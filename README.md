# devcontainer-build-run

devcontainer-build-run is the start of a GitHub action aimed at making it easier to re-use a [Visual Studio Code dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in a GitHub workflow.

**Status: this is a pet project that I've been experimenting with. It is not supported and you should expect bugs :-)**
